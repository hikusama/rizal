      <h2>Overall Reflection</h2>
      <p>Taking this course has been a meaningful journey that helped me grow not just academically, but also personally. At first, I thought we would just study facts and historical figures, but as we progressed, I realized that it was about more than dates or names—it was about understanding identity, values, and our role in shaping the future. One of the biggest turning points for me was learning about the life and works of José Rizal. His story made me reflect on how much impact one person can make through education, courage, and purpose. It pushed me to think critically, question what I used to take for granted, and become more aware of the struggles and sacrifices that shaped our nation. I also became more engaged in discussions, knowing that our history still speaks to the issues we face today. Academically, I developed stronger research and analytical skills, especially in interpreting texts like Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo. I also learned how to connect the past to the present—something I didn’t fully appreciate before. Personally, I became more appreciative of my heritage and more responsible in how I express my views and take part in conversations about society. This course has influenced my mindset in ways that will stick with me beyond school. It made me realize that change doesn’t always come from grand gestures—sometimes it begins with understanding, reflection, and the courage to speak up. In whatever path I take, whether in community work, a future career, or just in everyday choices, I’ll carry with me the lessons of Rizal and what it means to live with purpose and integrity.</p>
